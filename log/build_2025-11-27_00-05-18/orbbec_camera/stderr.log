[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:46 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findimage_publisher.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "image_publisher", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "image_publisher"
  with any of the following names:

    image_publisherConfig.cmake
    image_publisher-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "image_publisher" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "image_publisher_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.
  If "image_publisher" provides a separate development package or SDK, be
  sure it has been installed.
